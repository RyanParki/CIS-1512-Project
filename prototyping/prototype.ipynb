    "## Intro\n",
    "Our project relies on multiple datasets to provide users with flowers based on their desired colors. Research indicates that, surprisingly, there is no unified extensive dataset of flower data and colors, so various public sources are combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Flower REflectance Databse, from reflectance.co.uk, is an academic project from Queen Mary, University of London to establish build a database of flower colors. It is the most complete dataset of its kind. The terms of use indicate that it is permissible to use the data for this usecase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Perenual API from perenual.com has a feature rich and complete dataset with flower info and images. One can make 100 API calls per day for free with a registered account, which is sufficient for this usecase. API queries will be cached locally as the source data is unlikely to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "* The FReD website is quite old, has no API, and the results page table has malformed HTML. It is necessarry to do some cleanup, parse the HTML, sanitize and enrich the data, then build a relational database from it.\n",
    "* The FReD database's color field requires some normalization. Some examples:\n",
    "  * Qualifiers e.g. **dark yellow**, **metallic green**\n",
    "    * In these cases, the qualifier will be stripped.\n",
    "  * Compound colors e.g. **white-light purple**, **violet-brown-green**\n",
    "    * These cases present an opprutinity to enrich and extend the source data by building multiple records for each flower by color.\n",
    "  * Specific shades e.g. **cream**, **lilac**\n",
    "    * These will be normalized to CMYK colors.\n",
